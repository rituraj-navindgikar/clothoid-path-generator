The quintic splines and Bézier curves can be easily solved or
modified with the boundary conditions or control points, which
makes them easily integrated with the optimization methods.

However, these two curves make no promise on the maximum
curvature and the curvature change rate, which may lead to
kinetically infeasible solutions


The clothoid-based path can overcome the curvature issue.

The clothoid is a curve whose curvature changes linearly along
the arc length, allowing us to control each point’s curvature
by adjusting the curve length and curvature at two boundaries
